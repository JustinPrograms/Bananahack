# Danny COVIDO

## Inspiration
We took inspiration from the current world events and the lack of people's knowledge on COVID-19 data.

## What it does
DannyCOVIDO gives up to date worldwide and country based data on the current amount of cases in that region.

## How we built it
DannyCOVIDO was built in pure java with the use of APIs such as Wolfram Technologies' Wolfram Alpha to create graphs from the data collected as well as Trackcorona.live's api on COVID data from provinces and countries around the world

## Challenges we ran into
- A challenge we ran into was that Wolfram Alpha's Full API returned XML, which was hard to parse in java because tools were limited.
- Another Challenge we faced was the lack of time management. We didn't plan out our time the best we could have.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how the bot turned out because it took a lot of effort from the two of us to make it have all of the features it does

## What we learned
- We learned how cool Wolfram Alpha was and the features it has to graph out data given a set of points
- We learned how to parse XML in Java using a tool called Jsoup

## What's next for DannyCOVIDO
- More Data: Danny already is collecting data from many sources but is still missing things like some countries and provinces/states
- More graphs: Graphs are fun to look at and we should add more
- Better graphs: Our current graphs are great and all, but it would be better if we could have more in depth ones
- Other statistics: Recovered, deaths, etc...
